# zombies-utils
##### Download latest release: [v1.3.0-pre5](https://github.com/Stachelbeere1248/zombies-utils/releases/tag/v1.3.0-pre5).
Hello, I am currently working on this mod. More features will come. For now it has:
- An accurate timer + Automatic splitting
- Tracking of splits & segment PBs (with custom categories)
- SLA hud
- 1 chat macro
- Spawntime (no aa colors yet, but Rocket Launcher mode)
#### Disclaimers
- If you are using a Hypixel language other than the selected one the mod may not work entirely. Check config.
## For Users
The timer automatically splits every round. The PB/Segment recorder automatically distinguishes maps and difficulties, but not player count.
### Config
- Language: The selected Hypixel language. Currently supports EN,FR,DE.
- Timer:
  - Default Category: The record-category to be selected when starting the game.
  - Paste Delta: Whether to include +- relative to PB when clicking the round summaries to paste it in chat.
  - PB Announcements: Whether to show **\*\*\*NEW PERSONAL BEST\*\*\*** on PB in summaries.
- SST:
  - Enabled: Enables / disables this feature.
  - Auditory: A List of tick offsets that a sound should be played. Default (-40, -20, 0) means 2s and 1s in advance, as well as on spawn.
  - RL pre-timing: During RL mode, how much SST times sohuld be offsetted. Defaults to 1.4s earlier. Affects HUD as well as auditory.
  - Truncate: Whether to show passed rounds in the HUD.
- SLA:
  - Enabled: Whether the SLA HUD should automatically be shown when starting a game.
  - Truncate: Whether inactive windows and rooms should be shown.
- Macro Message: The Message to be sent when pressing the Chat Macro Key. Do NOT use "ยง" as symbol.
- Player Visibility: Whether to show players even if they are within a 4 block radius or not.
- CPS Counter: A simple CPS Counter which shows the amount of clicks within the last 20 gameticks.
### Commands
- /category \<name> - Switches to the category called name. All recorded times are bound to its category. Tabcomplete suggests already existing categories, but you can insert a new (clean) one as well.
  - Examples:
    - /category pistol_only
    - /category no_doors_solo
  - note: you do NOT need to make your own categories to seperate difficulties or map
- /sla \<off|map|quick|rotate|mirror|offset>
  - /sla off - Disables the SLA hud
  - /sla map \<de|bb|aa> - forcefully set the map
  - /sla quick \<mogi_a|ghxula|ghxula-garden>
  - /sla rotate - rotates all windows around the axis (0,y,0)
  - /sla mirror \<x|z> - mirrors all windows along the plane (0,y,z) or (x,y,0)
  - /sla offset \<x> \<y> \<z> - set an offset, allowing you to use sla on map-recreations, such as housings
- /zombiesutils \<timer>
  - /zombiesutils timer \<kill|split>
    - /zombiesutils timer kill - Stops the running timer completely
    - /zombiesutils timer split \<round> - Splits as if \<round> was passed, not recommended to use as it might create impossible PBs.
- /qz \<de|bb|aa|p> - sends you to a new game of Dead End, Bad Blood, Alien Arcadium or Prison
### Hotkeys
- Chat Macro: sends the message specified in the config
- RL Mode: Toggle usage of the rocket launcher mode spawn-time offset.
### Extra
- Managing split-categories: In your game directory is a folder called "zombies" which contains the folder "splits". You can simply rename or delete the folders inside "splits". You can also edit your splits, the data is stored as a list of ticks inside the MAP_DIFFICULTY.times files, a simple text editor (such as Notepad on Windows) should be able to edit it (UTF-16 encoded text). The other subfolder, runs, logs all the splits for every run you play.
